    <h1>Butter Chicken</h1>

    <p>It didn’t matter where I lived, butter chicken aka Murgh Makhani, was the dish we always ordered at a restaurant or got as takeout. Over the years, I’ve received many requests for this dish and finally got a recipe that I know you will love. I’m very proud of how good this turned out (since it took so many tries and plenty of tinkering). The sauce is smooth and velvety and glides over the roasted succulent chicken pieces with a joyful speed. Don’t take my word for it; watch it slide over a bowl of hot rice, and you’ll see what I mean.</p>
